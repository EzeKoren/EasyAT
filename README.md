# EasyAT

A custom ESP 01 firmware that makes everything easier. You're welcome.

## Cool, but why?

There's a common problem when using an ESP 01 module alongside other boards, like an Arduino UNO. While the ESP8266 inside the module is impressively powerful, the AT firmware is subpar, unintuitive, and doesn't work consistently.

Meet **EasyAT**, the easy to use, easy to mod firmware for the ESP 01 module.

**TODO**: Make a half decent README
